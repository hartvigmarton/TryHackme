Mean Lion
A Screenplay by Anonymous
EXT. GREENWICH, LONDON - AFTERNOON

Clever lawyer LORD GREGORY RANDALL is arguing with witty homemaker MADAME HARRIET PARKER. GREGORY tries to hug HARRIET but she shakes him off.

GREGORY
Please Harriet, don't leave me.
HARRIET
I'm sorry Gregory, but I'm looking for somebody a bit more brave. Somebody who faces his fears head on, instead of running away.
GREGORY
I am such a person!
HARRIET frowns.

HARRIET
I'm sorry, Gregory. I just don't feel excited by this relationship anymore.
HARRIET leaves.

GREGORY sits down, looking defeated.

Moments later, admirable fishmonger MISS HELEN BARLOW barges in looking flustered.

GREGORY
Goodness, Helen! Is everything okay?
HELEN
I'm afraid not.
GREGORY
What is it? Don't keep me in suspense...
HELEN
It's ... a lion ... I saw an evil lion fire a bunch of elderly gents!
GREGORY
Defenseless elderly gents?
HELEN
Yes, defenseless elderly gents!
GREGORY
Bloomin' heck, Helen! We've got to do something.
HELEN
I agree, but I wouldn't know where to start.
GREGORY
You can start by telling me where this happened.
HELEN
I was...
HELEN fans herself and begins to wheeze.

GREGORY
Focus Helen, focus! Where did it happen?
HELEN
A greasy diner! That's right - A greasy diner!
GREGORY springs up and begins to run.


EXT. A ROAD - CONTINUOUS

GREGORY rushes along the street, followed by HELEN. They take a short cut through some back gardens, jumping fences along the way.


EXT. A GREASY DINER - SHORTLY AFTER

CASPER DEVITO a mean lion terrorises two elderly gents.

GREGORY, closely followed by HELEN, rushes towards CASPER, but suddenly stops in his tracks.

HELEN
What is is? What's the matter?
GREGORY
That's not just any old lion, that's Casper DeVito!
HELEN
Who's Casper DeVito?
GREGORY
Who's Casper DeVito? Who's Casper DeVito? Only the most mean lion in the universe!
HELEN
Blinkin' knickers, Gregory! We're going to need some help if we're going to stop the most mean lion in the universe!
GREGORY
You can say that again.
HELEN
Blinkin' knickers, Gregory! We're going to need some help if we're going to stop the most mean lion in the universe!
GREGORY
I'm going to need candlesticks, lots of candlesticks.
Casper turns and sees Gregory and Helen. He grins an evil grin.

CASPER
Gregory Randall, we meet again.
HELEN
You've met?
GREGORY
Yes. It was a long, long time ago...

EXT. A PARK - BACK IN TIME

A young GREGORY is sitting in a park listening to some piano music, when suddenly a dark shadow casts over him.

He looks up and sees CASPER. He takes off his headphones.

CASPER
Would you like some jelly tots?
GREGORY's eyes light up, but then he studies CASPER more closely, and looks uneasy.

GREGORY
I don't know, you look kind of mean.
CASPER
Me? No. I'm not mean. I'm the least mean lion in the world.
GREGORY
Wait, you're a lion?
GREGORY runs away, screaming.


EXT. A GREASY DINER - PRESENT DAY

CASPER
You were a coward then, and you are a coward now.
HELEN
(To GREGORY) You ran away?
GREGORY
(To HELEN) I was a young child. What was I supposed to do?
GREGORY turns to CASPER.

GREGORY
I may have run away from you then, but I won't run away this time!
GREGORY runs away.

He turns back and shouts.

GREGORY
I mean, I am running away, but I'll be back - with candlesticks.
CASPER
I'm not scared of you.
GREGORY
You should be.

INT. KINGS CROSS STATION, LONDON - LATER THAT DAY

GREGORY and HELEN walk around searching for something.

GREGORY
I feel sure I left my candlesticks somewhere around here.
HELEN
Are you sure? It does seem like an odd place to keep deadly candlesticks.
GREGORY
You know nothing Helen Barlow.
HELEN
We've been searching for ages. I really don't think they're here.
Suddenly, CASPER appears, holding a pair of candlesticks.

CASPER
Looking for something?
HELEN
Crikey, Gregory, he's got your candlesticks.
GREGORY
Tell me something I don't already know!
HELEN
The earth's circumference at the equator is about 40,075 km.
GREGORY
I know that already!
HELEN
I still wear nappies.
CASPER
(appalled) Dude!
While CASPER is looking at HELEN with disgust, GREGORY lunges forward and grabs his deadly candlesticks. He wields them, triumphantly.

GREGORY
Prepare to die, you mean turnip!
CASPER
No please! All I did was fire a bunch of elderly gents!
HARRIET enters, unseen by any of the others.

GREGORY
I cannot tolerate that kind of behaviour! Those elderly gents were defenceless! Well now they have a defender - and that's me! Gregory Randall defender of innocent elderly gents.
CASPER
Don't hurt me! Please!
GREGORY
Give me one good reason why I shouldn't use these candlesticks on you right away!
CASPER
Because Gregory, I am your father.
GREGORY looks stunned for a few moments, but then collects himself.

GREGORY
No you're not!
CASPER
Ah well, it had to be worth a try.
CASPER tries to grab the candlesticks but GREGORY dodges out of the way.

GREGORY
Who's the daddy now? Huh? Huh?
Unexpectedly, CASPER slumps to the ground.

HELEN
Did he just faint?
GREGORY
I think so. Well that's disappointing. I was rather hoping for a more dramatic conclusion, involving my deadly candlesticks.
GREGORY crouches over CASPER's body.

HELEN
Be careful, Gregory. It could be a trick.
GREGORY
No, it's not a trick. It appears that... It would seem... Casper DeVito is dead!
GREGORY
What?
GREGORY
Yes, it appears that I scared him to death.
HELEN claps her hands.

HELEN
So your candlesticks did save the day, after all.
HARRIET steps forward.

HARRIET
Is it true? Did you kill the mean lion?
GREGORY
Harriet how long have you been...?
HARRIET puts her arm around GREGORY.

HARRIET
Long enough.
GREGORY
Then you saw it for yourself. I killed Casper DeVito.
HARRIET
Then the elderly gents are safe?
GREGORY
It does seem that way!
A crowd of vulnerable elderly gents enter, looking relived.

HARRIET
You are their hero.
The elderly gents bow to GREGORY.

GREGORY
There is no need to bow to me. I seek no worship. The knowledge that Casper DeVito will never fire elderly gents ever again, is enough for me.
HARRIET
You are humble as well as brave!
One of the elderly gents passes GREGORY a healing pendant

HARRIET
I think they want you to have it, as a symbol of their gratitude.
GREGORY
I couldn't possibly.
Pause.

GREGORY
Well, if you insist.
GREGORY takes the pendant.

GREGORY
Thank you.
The elderly gents bow their heads once more, and leave.

GREGORY turns to HARRIET.

GREGORY
Does this mean you want me back?
HARRIET
Oh, Gregory, of course I want you back!
GREGORY smiles for a few seconds, but then looks defiant.

GREGORY
Well you can't have me.
HARRIET
WHAT?
GREGORY
You had no faith in me. You had to see my scare a lion to death before you would believe in me. I don't want a lover like that.
HARRIET
But...
GREGORY
Please leave. I want to spend time with the one person who stayed with me through thick and thin - my best friend, Helen.
HELEN grins.

HARRIET
But...
HELEN
You heard the gentleman. Now be off with you. Skidaddle! Shoo!
HARRIET
Gregory?
GREGORY
I'm sorry Harriet, but I think you should skidaddle.
HARRIET leaves.

HELEN turns to GREGORY.

HELEN
Did you mean that? You know ... that I'm your best friend?
GREGORY
Of course you are!
The two walk off arm in arm.

Suddenly HELEN stops.

HELEN
When I said I still wear nappies, you know I was just trying to distract the lion don't you?
THE END
