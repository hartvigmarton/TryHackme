Selfish Ghost
A Screenplay by Untitled writer
EXT. A LIBRARY - AFTERNOON

Popular police officer DCI MARY RUSSELL is arguing with sweet mechanic MASTER SHANE GIANTBULB. MARY tries to hug SHANE but he shakes her off.

MARY
Please Shane, don't leave me.
SHANE
I'm sorry Mary, but I'm looking for somebody a bit more brave. Somebody who faces her fears head on, instead of running away.
MARY
I am such a person!
SHANE frowns.

SHANE
I'm sorry, Mary. I just don't feel excited by this relationship anymore.
SHANE leaves.

MARY sits down, looking defeated.

Moments later, splendid cleaner PROF HARRY TORRANCE barges in looking flustered.

MARY
Goodness, Harry! Is everything okay?
HARRY
I'm afraid not.
MARY
What is it? Don't keep me in suspense...
HARRY
It's ... a ghost ... I saw an evil ghost gobble a bunch of babies!
MARY
Defenseless babies?
HARRY
Yes, defenseless babies!
MARY
Bloomin' heck, Harry! We've got to do something.
HARRY
I agree, but I wouldn't know where to start.
MARY
You can start by telling me where this happened.
HARRY
I was...
HARRY fans himself and begins to wheeze.

MARY
Focus Harry, focus! Where did it happen?
HARRY
A Sweet Shop! That's right - A Sweet Shop!
MARY springs up and begins to run.


EXT. A ROAD - CONTINUOUS

MARY rushes along the street, followed by HARRY. They take a short cut through some back gardens, jumping fences along the way.


INT. A SWEET SHOP - SHORTLY AFTER

JOSH HUMBLE a selfish ghost terrorises two babies.

MARY, closely followed by HARRY, rushes towards JOSH, but suddenly stops in her tracks.

HARRY
What is is? What's the matter?
MARY
That's not just any old ghost, that's Josh Humble!
HARRY
Who's Josh Humble?
MARY
Who's Josh Humble? Who's Josh Humble? Only the most selfish ghost in the universe!
HARRY
Blinkin' knickers, Mary! We're going to need some help if we're going to stop the most selfish ghost in the universe!
MARY
You can say that again.
HARRY
Blinkin' knickers, Mary! We're going to need some help if we're going to stop the most selfish ghost in the universe!
MARY
I'm going to need razors, lots of razors.
Josh turns and sees Mary and Harry. He grins an evil grin.

JOSH
Mary Russell, we meet again.
HARRY
You've met?
MARY
Yes. It was a long, long time ago...

EXT. A PARK - BACK IN TIME

A young MARY is sitting in a park listening to some indie music, when suddenly a dark shadow casts over her.

She looks up and sees JOSH. She takes off her headphones.

JOSH
Would you like some white mice?
MARY's eyes light up, but then he studies JOSH more closely, and looks uneasy.

MARY
I don't know, you look kind of selfish.
JOSH
Me? No. I'm not selfish. I'm the least selfish ghost in the world.
MARY
Wait, you're a ghost?
MARY runs away, screaming.


INT. A SWEET SHOP - PRESENT DAY

JOSH
You were a coward then, and you are a coward now.
HARRY
(To MARY) You ran away?
MARY
(To HARRY) I was a young child. What was I supposed to do?
MARY turns to JOSH.

MARY
I may have run away from you then, but I won't run away this time!
MARY runs away.

She turns back and shouts.

MARY
I mean, I am running away, but I'll be back - with razors.
JOSH
I'm not scared of you.
MARY
You should be.

INT. SYDNEY OPERA HOUSE - LATER THAT DAY

MARY and HARRY walk around searching for something.

MARY
I feel sure I left my razors somewhere around here.
HARRY
Are you sure? It does seem like an odd place to keep deadly razors.
MARY
You know nothing Harry Torrance.
HARRY
We've been searching for ages. I really don't think they're here.
Suddenly, JOSH appears, holding a pair of razors.

JOSH
Looking for something?
HARRY
Crikey, Mary, he's got your razors.
MARY
Tell me something I don't already know!
HARRY
The earth's circumference at the equator is about 40,075 km.
MARY
I know that already!
HARRY
I pickle my earwax and keep it in a jar under my bed.
JOSH
(appalled) Dude!
While JOSH is looking at HARRY with disgust, MARY lunges forward and grabs her deadly razors. He wields them, triumphantly.

MARY
Prepare to die, you selfish aubergine!
JOSH
No please! All I did was gobble a bunch of babies!
SHANE enters, unseen by any of the others.

MARY
I cannot tolerate that kind of behaviour! Those babies were defenceless! Well now they have a defender - and that's me! Mary Russell defender of innocent babies.
JOSH
Don't hurt me! Please!
MARY
Give me one good reason why I shouldn't use these razors on you right away!
JOSH
Because Mary, I am your father.
MARY looks stunned for a few moments, but then collects herself.

MARY
No you're not!
JOSH
Ah well, it had to be worth a try.
JOSH tries to grab the razors but MARY dodges out of the way.

MARY
Who's the daddy now? Huh? Huh?
Unexpectedly, JOSH slumps to the ground.

HARRY
Did he just faint?
MARY
I think so. Well that's disappointing. I was rather hoping for a more dramatic conclusion, involving my deadly razors.
MARY crouches over JOSH's body.

HARRY
Be careful, Mary. It could be a trick.
MARY
No, it's not a trick. It appears that... It would seem... Josh Humble is dead!
MARY
What?
MARY
Yes, it appears that I scared him to death.
HARRY claps his hands.

HARRY
So your razors did save the day, after all.
SHANE steps forward.

SHANE
Is it true? Did you kill the selfish ghost?
MARY
Shane how long have you been...?
SHANE puts his arm around MARY.

SHANE
Long enough.
MARY
Then you saw it for yourself. I killed Josh Humble.
SHANE
Then the babies are safe?
MARY
It does seem that way!
A crowd of vulnerable babies enter, looking relived.

SHANE
You are their hero.
The babies bow to MARY.

MARY
There is no need to bow to me. I seek no worship. The knowledge that Josh Humble will never gobble babies ever again, is enough for me.
SHANE
You are humble as well as brave!
One of the babies passes MARY a wooden ring

SHANE
I think they want you to have it, as a symbol of their gratitude.
MARY
I couldn't possibly.
Pause.

MARY
Well, if you insist.
MARY takes the ring.

MARY
Thank you.
The babies bow their heads once more, and leave.

MARY turns to SHANE.

MARY
Does this mean you want me back?
SHANE
Oh, Mary, of course I want you back!
MARY smiles for a few seconds, but then looks defiant.

MARY
Well you can't have me.
SHANE
WHAT?
MARY
You had no faith in me. You had to see my scare a ghost to death before you would believe in me. I don't want a lover like that.
SHANE
But...
MARY
Please leave. I want to spend time with the one person who stayed with me through thick and thin - my best friend, Harry.
HARRY grins.

SHANE
But...
HARRY
You heard the lady. Now be off with you. Skidaddle! Shoo!
SHANE
Mary?
MARY
I'm sorry Shane, but I think you should skidaddle.
SHANE leaves.

HARRY turns to MARY.

HARRY
Did you mean that? You know ... that I'm your best friend?
MARY
Of course you are!
The two walk off arm in arm.

Suddenly HARRY stops.

HARRY
When I said I pickle my earwax and keep it in a jar under my bed, you know I was just trying to distract the ghost don't you?
THE END
