Tactless Tiger
A Screenplay by Anonymous
EXT. A GREASY DINER - AFTERNOON

Incredible navigator MR ROGER THOMAS is arguing with adorable psychiatrist DR SHANE HUMBLE. ROGER tries to hug SHANE but he shakes him off.

ROGER
Please Shane, don't leave me.
SHANE
I'm sorry Roger, but I'm looking for somebody a bit more brave. Somebody who faces his fears head on, instead of running away.
ROGER
I am such a person!
SHANE frowns.

SHANE
I'm sorry, Roger. I just don't feel excited by this relationship anymore.
SHANE leaves.

ROGER sits down, looking defeated.

Moments later, loving shopkeeper MRS BETH PARKER barges in looking flustered.

ROGER
Goodness, Beth! Is everything okay?
BETH
I'm afraid not.
ROGER
What is it? Don't keep me in suspense...
BETH
It's ... a tiger ... I saw an evil tiger prod a bunch of baby birds!
ROGER
Defenseless baby birds?
BETH
Yes, defenseless baby birds!
ROGER
Bloomin' heck, Beth! We've got to do something.
BETH
I agree, but I wouldn't know where to start.
ROGER
You can start by telling me where this happened.
BETH
I was...
BETH fans herself and begins to wheeze.

ROGER
Focus Beth, focus! Where did it happen?
BETH
Chippewa Square, Savannah! That's right - Chippewa Square, Savannah!
ROGER springs up and begins to run.


EXT. A ROAD - CONTINUOUS

ROGER rushes along the street, followed by BETH. They take a short cut through some back gardens, jumping fences along the way.


EXT. CHIPPEWA SQUARE, SAVANNAH - SHORTLY AFTER

MO RAYMOND a tactless tiger terrorises two baby birds.

ROGER, closely followed by BETH, rushes towards MO, but suddenly stops in his tracks.

BETH
What is is? What's the matter?
ROGER
That's not just any old tiger, that's Mo Raymond!
BETH
Who's Mo Raymond?
ROGER
Who's Mo Raymond? Who's Mo Raymond? Only the most tactless tiger in the universe!
BETH
Blinkin' knickers, Roger! We're going to need some help if we're going to stop the most tactless tiger in the universe!
ROGER
You can say that again.
BETH
Blinkin' knickers, Roger! We're going to need some help if we're going to stop the most tactless tiger in the universe!
ROGER
I'm going to need guns, lots of guns.
Mo turns and sees Roger and Beth. He grins an evil grin.

MO
Roger Thomas, we meet again.
BETH
You've met?
ROGER
Yes. It was a long, long time ago...

EXT. A PARK - BACK IN TIME

A young ROGER is sitting in a park listening to some jazz music, when suddenly a dark shadow casts over him.

He looks up and sees MO. He takes off his headphones.

MO
Would you like some toffees?
ROGER's eyes light up, but then he studies MO more closely, and looks uneasy.

ROGER
I don't know, you look kind of tactless.
MO
Me? No. I'm not tactless. I'm the least tactless tiger in the world.
ROGER
Wait, you're a tiger?
ROGER runs away, screaming.


EXT. CHIPPEWA SQUARE, SAVANNAH - PRESENT DAY

MO
You were a coward then, and you are a coward now.
BETH
(To ROGER) You ran away?
ROGER
(To BETH) I was a young child. What was I supposed to do?
ROGER turns to MO.

ROGER
I may have run away from you then, but I won't run away this time!
ROGER runs away.

He turns back and shouts.

ROGER
I mean, I am running away, but I'll be back - with guns.
MO
I'm not scared of you.
ROGER
You should be.

INT. A SWEET SHOP - LATER THAT DAY

ROGER and BETH walk around searching for something.

ROGER
I feel sure I left my guns somewhere around here.
BETH
Are you sure? It does seem like an odd place to keep deadly guns.
ROGER
You know nothing Beth Parker.
BETH
We've been searching for ages. I really don't think they're here.
Suddenly, MO appears, holding a pair of guns.

MO
Looking for something?
BETH
Crikey, Roger, he's got your guns.
ROGER
Tell me something I don't already know!
BETH
The earth's circumference at the equator is about 40,075 km.
ROGER
I know that already!
BETH
I'm afraid of sausages.
MO
(appalled) Dude!
While MO is looking at BETH with disgust, ROGER lunges forward and grabs his deadly guns. He wields them, triumphantly.

ROGER
Prepare to die, you tactless cauliflower!
MO
No please! All I did was prod a bunch of baby birds!
SHANE enters, unseen by any of the others.

ROGER
I cannot tolerate that kind of behaviour! Those baby birds were defenceless! Well now they have a defender - and that's me! Roger Thomas defender of innocent baby birds.
MO
Don't hurt me! Please!
ROGER
Give me one good reason why I shouldn't use these guns on you right away!
MO
Because Roger, I am your father.
ROGER looks stunned for a few moments, but then collects himself.

ROGER
No you're not!
MO
Ah well, it had to be worth a try.
MO tries to grab the guns but ROGER dodges out of the way.

ROGER
Who's the daddy now? Huh? Huh?
Unexpectedly, MO slumps to the ground.

BETH
Did he just faint?
ROGER
I think so. Well that's disappointing. I was rather hoping for a more dramatic conclusion, involving my deadly guns.
ROGER crouches over MO's body.

BETH
Be careful, Roger. It could be a trick.
ROGER
No, it's not a trick. It appears that... It would seem... Mo Raymond is dead!
ROGER
What?
ROGER
Yes, it appears that I scared him to death.
BETH claps her hands.

BETH
So your guns did save the day, after all.
SHANE steps forward.

SHANE
Is it true? Did you kill the tactless tiger?
ROGER
Shane how long have you been...?
SHANE puts his arm around ROGER.

SHANE
Long enough.
ROGER
Then you saw it for yourself. I killed Mo Raymond.
SHANE
Then the baby birds are safe?
ROGER
It does seem that way!
A crowd of vulnerable baby birds enter, looking relived.

SHANE
You are their hero.
The baby birds bow to ROGER.

ROGER
There is no need to bow to me. I seek no worship. The knowledge that Mo Raymond will never prod baby birds ever again, is enough for me.
SHANE
You are humble as well as brave!
One of the baby birds passes ROGER a magic ring

SHANE
I think they want you to have it, as a symbol of their gratitude.
ROGER
I couldn't possibly.
Pause.

ROGER
Well, if you insist.
ROGER takes the ring.

ROGER
Thank you.
The baby birds bow their heads once more, and leave.

ROGER turns to SHANE.

ROGER
Does this mean you want me back?
SHANE
Oh, Roger, of course I want you back!
ROGER smiles for a few seconds, but then looks defiant.

ROGER
Well you can't have me.
SHANE
WHAT?
ROGER
You had no faith in me. You had to see my scare a tiger to death before you would believe in me. I don't want a lover like that.
SHANE
But...
ROGER
Please leave. I want to spend time with the one person who stayed with me through thick and thin - my best friend, Beth.
BETH grins.

SHANE
But...
BETH
You heard the gentleman. Now be off with you. Skidaddle! Shoo!
SHANE
Roger?
ROGER
I'm sorry Shane, but I think you should skidaddle.
SHANE leaves.

BETH turns to ROGER.

BETH
Did you mean that? You know ... that I'm your best friend?
ROGER
Of course you are!
The two walk off arm in arm.

Suddenly BETH stops.

BETH
When I said I'm afraid of sausages, you know I was just trying to distract the tiger don't you?
