Cowardly Goblin
A Screenplay by Mr Pseudonym
EXT. A GREASY DINER - AFTERNOON

Virtuous nurse MADAME KIMBERLY GOBBLE is arguing with virtuous private detective DI MOLLY SNOZCUMBER. KIMBERLY tries to hug MOLLY but she shakes her off.

KIMBERLY
Please Molly, don't leave me.
MOLLY
I'm sorry Kimberly, but I'm looking for somebody a bit more brave. Somebody who faces her fears head on, instead of running away.
KIMBERLY
I am such a person!
MOLLY frowns.

MOLLY
I'm sorry, Kimberly. I just don't feel excited by this relationship anymore.
MOLLY leaves.

KIMBERLY sits down, looking defeated.

Moments later, admirable nurse SIR WARWICK BOND barges in looking flustered.

KIMBERLY
Goodness, Warwick! Is everything okay?
WARWICK
I'm afraid not.
KIMBERLY
What is it? Don't keep me in suspense...
WARWICK
It's ... a goblin ... I saw an evil goblin terrify a bunch of babies!
KIMBERLY
Defenseless babies?
WARWICK
Yes, defenseless babies!
KIMBERLY
Bloomin' heck, Warwick! We've got to do something.
WARWICK
I agree, but I wouldn't know where to start.
KIMBERLY
You can start by telling me where this happened.
WARWICK
I was...
WARWICK fans himself and begins to wheeze.

KIMBERLY
Focus Warwick, focus! Where did it happen?
WARWICK
Hamstead Heath, London! That's right - Hamstead Heath, London!
KIMBERLY springs up and begins to run.


EXT. A ROAD - CONTINUOUS

KIMBERLY rushes along the street, followed by WARWICK. They take a short cut through some back gardens, jumping fences along the way.


INT. HAMSTEAD HEATH, LONDON - SHORTLY AFTER

JOSH DEVITO a cowardly goblin terrorises two babies.

KIMBERLY, closely followed by WARWICK, rushes towards JOSH, but suddenly stops in her tracks.

WARWICK
What is is? What's the matter?
KIMBERLY
That's not just any old goblin, that's Josh DeVito!
WARWICK
Who's Josh DeVito?
KIMBERLY
Who's Josh DeVito? Who's Josh DeVito? Only the most cowardly goblin in the universe!
WARWICK
Blinkin' knickers, Kimberly! We're going to need some help if we're going to stop the most cowardly goblin in the universe!
KIMBERLY
You can say that again.
WARWICK
Blinkin' knickers, Kimberly! We're going to need some help if we're going to stop the most cowardly goblin in the universe!
KIMBERLY
I'm going to need nets, lots of nets.
Josh turns and sees Kimberly and Warwick. He grins an evil grin.

JOSH
Kimberly Gobble, we meet again.
WARWICK
You've met?
KIMBERLY
Yes. It was a long, long time ago...

EXT. A PARK - BACK IN TIME

A young KIMBERLY is sitting in a park listening to some indie music, when suddenly a dark shadow casts over her.

She looks up and sees JOSH. She takes off her headphones.

JOSH
Would you like some peppermints?
KIMBERLY's eyes light up, but then he studies JOSH more closely, and looks uneasy.

KIMBERLY
I don't know, you look kind of cowardly.
JOSH
Me? No. I'm not cowardly. I'm the least cowardly goblin in the world.
KIMBERLY
Wait, you're a goblin?
KIMBERLY runs away, screaming.


INT. HAMSTEAD HEATH, LONDON - PRESENT DAY

JOSH
You were a coward then, and you are a coward now.
WARWICK
(To KIMBERLY) You ran away?
KIMBERLY
(To WARWICK) I was a young child. What was I supposed to do?
KIMBERLY turns to JOSH.

KIMBERLY
I may have run away from you then, but I won't run away this time!
KIMBERLY runs away.

She turns back and shouts.

KIMBERLY
I mean, I am running away, but I'll be back - with nets.
JOSH
I'm not scared of you.
KIMBERLY
You should be.

INT. A SWEET SHOP - LATER THAT DAY

KIMBERLY and WARWICK walk around searching for something.

KIMBERLY
I feel sure I left my nets somewhere around here.
WARWICK
Are you sure? It does seem like an odd place to keep deadly nets.
KIMBERLY
You know nothing Warwick Bond.
WARWICK
We've been searching for ages. I really don't think they're here.
Suddenly, JOSH appears, holding a pair of nets.

JOSH
Looking for something?
WARWICK
Crikey, Kimberly, he's got your nets.
KIMBERLY
Tell me something I don't already know!
WARWICK
The earth's circumference at the equator is about 40,075 km.
KIMBERLY
I know that already!
WARWICK
I bite my toenails.
JOSH
(appalled) Dude!
While JOSH is looking at WARWICK with disgust, KIMBERLY lunges forward and grabs her deadly nets. He wields them, triumphantly.

KIMBERLY
Prepare to die, you cowardly cabbage!
JOSH
No please! All I did was terrify a bunch of babies!
MOLLY enters, unseen by any of the others.

KIMBERLY
I cannot tolerate that kind of behaviour! Those babies were defenceless! Well now they have a defender - and that's me! Kimberly Gobble defender of innocent babies.
JOSH
Don't hurt me! Please!
KIMBERLY
Give me one good reason why I shouldn't use these nets on you right away!
JOSH
Because Kimberly, I am your father.
KIMBERLY looks stunned for a few moments, but then collects herself.

KIMBERLY
No you're not!
JOSH
Ah well, it had to be worth a try.
JOSH tries to grab the nets but KIMBERLY dodges out of the way.

KIMBERLY
Who's the daddy now? Huh? Huh?
Unexpectedly, JOSH slumps to the ground.

WARWICK
Did he just faint?
KIMBERLY
I think so. Well that's disappointing. I was rather hoping for a more dramatic conclusion, involving my deadly nets.
KIMBERLY crouches over JOSH's body.

WARWICK
Be careful, Kimberly. It could be a trick.
KIMBERLY
No, it's not a trick. It appears that... It would seem... Josh DeVito is dead!
KIMBERLY
What?
KIMBERLY
Yes, it appears that I scared him to death.
WARWICK claps his hands.

WARWICK
So your nets did save the day, after all.
MOLLY steps forward.

MOLLY
Is it true? Did you kill the cowardly goblin?
KIMBERLY
Molly how long have you been...?
MOLLY puts her arm around KIMBERLY.

MOLLY
Long enough.
KIMBERLY
Then you saw it for yourself. I killed Josh DeVito.
MOLLY
Then the babies are safe?
KIMBERLY
It does seem that way!
A crowd of vulnerable babies enter, looking relived.

MOLLY
You are their hero.
The babies bow to KIMBERLY.

KIMBERLY
There is no need to bow to me. I seek no worship. The knowledge that Josh DeVito will never terrify babies ever again, is enough for me.
MOLLY
You are humble as well as brave!
One of the babies passes KIMBERLY a wooden pendant

MOLLY
I think they want you to have it, as a symbol of their gratitude.
KIMBERLY
I couldn't possibly.
Pause.

KIMBERLY
Well, if you insist.
KIMBERLY takes the pendant.

KIMBERLY
Thank you.
The babies bow their heads once more, and leave.

KIMBERLY turns to MOLLY.

KIMBERLY
Does this mean you want me back?
MOLLY
Oh, Kimberly, of course I want you back!
KIMBERLY smiles for a few seconds, but then looks defiant.

KIMBERLY
Well you can't have me.
MOLLY
WHAT?
KIMBERLY
You had no faith in me. You had to see my scare a goblin to death before you would believe in me. I don't want a lover like that.
MOLLY
But...
KIMBERLY
Please leave. I want to spend time with the one person who stayed with me through thick and thin - my best friend, Warwick.
WARWICK grins.

MOLLY
But...
WARWICK
You heard the lady. Now be off with you. Skidaddle! Shoo!
MOLLY
Kimberly?
KIMBERLY
I'm sorry Molly, but I think you should skidaddle.
MOLLY leaves.

WARWICK turns to KIMBERLY.

WARWICK
Did you mean that? You know ... that I'm your best friend?
KIMBERLY
Of course you are!
The two walk off arm in arm.

Suddenly WARWICK stops.

WARWICK
When I said I bite my toenails, you know I was just trying to distract the goblin don't you?
THE END
