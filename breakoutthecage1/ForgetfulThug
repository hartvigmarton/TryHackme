Forgetful Thug
A Screenplay by Mr Pseudonym
EXT. MIAMI BEACH - AFTERNOON

Admirable detective DR MATT FISH is arguing with generous actor SIR ROBERT WISHMONGER. MATT tries to hug ROBERT but he shakes him off.

MATT
Please Robert, don't leave me.
ROBERT
I'm sorry Matt, but I'm looking for somebody a bit more brave. Somebody who faces his fears head on, instead of running away.
MATT
I am such a person!
ROBERT frowns.

ROBERT
I'm sorry, Matt. I just don't feel excited by this relationship anymore.
ROBERT leaves.

MATT sits down, looking defeated.

Moments later, lovable mechanic DCI JENNY JONES barges in looking flustered.

MATT
Goodness, Jenny! Is everything okay?
JENNY
I'm afraid not.
MATT
What is it? Don't keep me in suspense...
JENNY
It's ... a thug ... I saw an evil thug gobble a bunch of elderly gents!
MATT
Defenseless elderly gents?
JENNY
Yes, defenseless elderly gents!
MATT
Bloomin' heck, Jenny! We've got to do something.
JENNY
I agree, but I wouldn't know where to start.
MATT
You can start by telling me where this happened.
JENNY
I was...
JENNY fans herself and begins to wheeze.

MATT
Focus Jenny, focus! Where did it happen?
JENNY
a library! That's right - a library!
MATT springs up and begins to run.


EXT. A ROAD - CONTINUOUS

MATT rushes along the street, followed by JENNY. They take a short cut through some back gardens, jumping fences along the way.


EXT. A LIBRARY - SHORTLY AFTER

SARAH MCCALLISTER a forgetful thug terrorises two elderly gents.

MATT, closely followed by JENNY, rushes towards SARAH, but suddenly stops in his tracks.

JENNY
What is is? What's the matter?
MATT
That's not just any old thug, that's Sarah McCallister!
JENNY
Who's Sarah McCallister?
MATT
Who's Sarah McCallister? Who's Sarah McCallister? Only the most forgetful thug in the universe!
JENNY
Blinkin' knickers, Matt! We're going to need some help if we're going to stop the most forgetful thug in the universe!
MATT
You can say that again.
JENNY
Blinkin' knickers, Matt! We're going to need some help if we're going to stop the most forgetful thug in the universe!
MATT
I'm going to need candlesticks, lots of candlesticks.
Sarah turns and sees Matt and Jenny. She grins an evil grin.

SARAH
Matt Fish, we meet again.
JENNY
You've met?
MATT
Yes. It was a long, long time ago...

EXT. A PARK - BACK IN TIME

A young MATT is sitting in a park listening to some reggae music, when suddenly a dark shadow casts over him.

He looks up and sees SARAH. He takes off his headphones.

SARAH
Would you like some fruit gums?
MATT's eyes light up, but then he studies SARAH more closely, and looks uneasy.

MATT
I don't know, you look kind of forgetful.
SARAH
Me? No. I'm not forgetful. I'm the least forgetful thug in the world.
MATT
Wait, you're a thug?
MATT runs away, screaming.


EXT. A LIBRARY - PRESENT DAY

SARAH
You were a coward then, and you are a coward now.
JENNY
(To MATT) You ran away?
MATT
(To JENNY) I was a young child. What was I supposed to do?
MATT turns to SARAH.

MATT
I may have run away from you then, but I won't run away this time!
MATT runs away.

He turns back and shouts.

MATT
I mean, I am running away, but I'll be back - with candlesticks.
SARAH
I'm not scared of you.
MATT
You should be.

EXT. CHIPPEWA SQUARE, SAVANNAH - LATER THAT DAY

MATT and JENNY walk around searching for something.

MATT
I feel sure I left my candlesticks somewhere around here.
JENNY
Are you sure? It does seem like an odd place to keep deadly candlesticks.
MATT
You know nothing Jenny Jones.
JENNY
We've been searching for ages. I really don't think they're here.
Suddenly, SARAH appears, holding a pair of candlesticks.

SARAH
Looking for something?
JENNY
Crikey, Matt, she's got your candlesticks.
MATT
Tell me something I don't already know!
JENNY
The earth's circumference at the equator is about 40,075 km.
MATT
I know that already!
JENNY
I still wear nappies.
SARAH
(appalled) Dude!
While SARAH is looking at JENNY with disgust, MATT lunges forward and grabs his deadly candlesticks. He wields them, triumphantly.

MATT
Prepare to die, you forgetful cauliflower!
SARAH
No please! All I did was gobble a bunch of elderly gents!
ROBERT enters, unseen by any of the others.

MATT
I cannot tolerate that kind of behaviour! Those elderly gents were defenceless! Well now they have a defender - and that's me! Matt Fish defender of innocent elderly gents.
SARAH
Don't hurt me! Please!
MATT
Give me one good reason why I shouldn't use these candlesticks on you right away!
SARAH
Because Matt, I am your mother.
MATT looks stunned for a few moments, but then collects himself.

MATT
No you're not!
SARAH
Ah well, it had to be worth a try.
SARAH tries to grab the candlesticks but MATT dodges out of the way.

MATT
Who's the mummy now? Huh? Huh?
Unexpectedly, SARAH slumps to the ground.

JENNY
Did she just faint?
MATT
I think so. Well that's disappointing. I was rather hoping for a more dramatic conclusion, involving my deadly candlesticks.
MATT crouches over SARAH's body.

JENNY
Be careful, Matt. It could be a trick.
MATT
No, it's not a trick. It appears that... It would seem... Sarah McCallister is dead!
MATT
What?
MATT
Yes, it appears that I scared her to death.
JENNY claps her hands.

JENNY
So your candlesticks did save the day, after all.
ROBERT steps forward.

ROBERT
Is it true? Did you kill the forgetful thug?
MATT
Robert how long have you been...?
ROBERT puts his arm around MATT.

ROBERT
Long enough.
MATT
Then you saw it for yourself. I killed Sarah McCallister.
ROBERT
Then the elderly gents are safe?
MATT
It does seem that way!
A crowd of vulnerable elderly gents enter, looking relived.

ROBERT
You are their hero.
The elderly gents bow to MATT.

MATT
There is no need to bow to me. I seek no worship. The knowledge that Sarah McCallister will never gobble elderly gents ever again, is enough for me.
ROBERT
You are humble as well as brave!
One of the elderly gents passes MATT a mystical bell

ROBERT
I think they want you to have it, as a symbol of their gratitude.
MATT
I couldn't possibly.
Pause.

MATT
Well, if you insist.
MATT takes the bell.

MATT
Thank you.
The elderly gents bow their heads once more, and leave.

MATT turns to ROBERT.

MATT
Does this mean you want me back?
ROBERT
Oh, Matt, of course I want you back!
MATT smiles for a few seconds, but then looks defiant.

MATT
Well you can't have me.
ROBERT
WHAT?
MATT
You had no faith in me. You had to see my scare a thug to death before you would believe in me. I don't want a lover like that.
ROBERT
But...
MATT
Please leave. I want to spend time with the one person who stayed with me through thick and thin - my best friend, Jenny.
JENNY grins.

ROBERT
But...
JENNY
You heard the gentleman. Now be off with you. Skidaddle! Shoo!
ROBERT
Matt?
MATT
I'm sorry Robert, but I think you should skidaddle.
ROBERT leaves.

JENNY turns to MATT.

JENNY
Did you mean that? You know ... that I'm your best friend?
MATT
Of course you are!
The two walk off arm in arm.

Suddenly JENNY stops.

JENNY
When I said I still wear nappies, you know I was just trying to distract the thug don't you?
THE END
